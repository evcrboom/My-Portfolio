              <p>
                ðŸ‘‹ My name is Boom. I'm pleased to meet you. I graduated with a
                Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Thammasat
                University. Currently, I'm honing my programming skills with the
                aspiration to work as a web developer. This website is designed
                to showcase my abilities and skills in programming. My hobbies
                include photography, playing basketball, piano, and computer
                games. I hope this allows you to get to know me better ðŸ’œ
